How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link?

The internet is a network of computers that use a protocols to communicate and share data. "Computers" includes your laptop, phone, tablet,
remote servers, and even smart appliances like your fridge. Protocols like http and https provide standardized rules that all the computers
can follow when communicating with each other so that data like webpages can be shared and understood by computers universally. Each computers
connected to the internet is assigned an IP address, and each IP address can be associated with a domain name, so that computers and humans,
respecitvely, can find resources on other computers connected to the internet.

When you click on a link, your computer (the client) looks at the URL contained in the link you clicked and sends a request to a Domain Name
Server to find the IP address associated with the domain name in that URL. The DNS responds with the associated IP address, and the client
then makes a request to that IP address, asking the server located there to send the resources so that the client can present those resources
to the user in the browser.
